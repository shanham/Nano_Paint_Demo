# Nano Paint Demo

This program was designed to demonstrate the principles of structural colouration for a science festival exhibit. It allows the users to construct colours through the creation of an array of nanoscale cylinders which selectively reflect light according to (semi-)realistic simulations in Comsol. The user can use the designed colours to paint a butterfly image.

To run the demonstration, run NanoPaint.py using Python 3. It requires PyQt4, OpenGL, Numpy and Scipy to run.
